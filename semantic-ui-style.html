            <p>	Maurizio Arrivabene (born in Brescia in 1957) is the current team principal of the Scuderia Ferrari Formula One team. He was appointed in November 2014, replacing Marco Mattiacci in the role.</p>
            <p>	Arrivabene comes from a marketing and sales background. In 1997, he joined Philip Morris, rising to become the Vice President of Marlboro Global Communication and Promotions for Philip Morris International in 2007 and the Vice President of Consumer Channel Strategy and Event Marketing in 2011. Through his work with Philip Morris, he became involved with the company's sponsorship (through the Marlboro brand) of the Ferrari team, and sat on the Formula One Commission as a representative for all the sport's sponsors from 2010.</p>
<p>
	On 23 November 2014, Ferrari announced that Arrivabene had been appointed as its team principal, replacing Marco Mattiacci, who had himself only been in the position since taking over from Stefano Domenicali in April that year. The decision to install Arrivabene was made by new Ferrari chairman, Sergio Marchionne, who gave Arrivabene's "thorough understanding not just of Ferrari but also of the governance mechanisms and requirements of the sport" as the reason for his appointment. This appointment was part of a team rejuvenation process by Marchionne who deposed the ex long-time Ferrari Chairman, Luca di Montezemolo, in September 2014.

He has also been an independent board member of Juventus F.C. since 2012.</p>

<p> Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen remain as the two drivers at Scuderia Ferrari, and stand as a very experienced duo who have both won world championships. Vettel enters the new season with the edge of his team mate for the last few seasons having finished with more wins and points at the end of the year. Raikkonen will be eager to put the past behind him and hopefully once again show his full potential on the track for a strong showing.</p>

<p> "The SF71H represents an evolution of last year’s car, which was already a good project," explained Technical Director, Mattia Binotto. "We’ve tried to retain the strengths. Our strengths I would say first is aggressiveness in some of the concepts. We designed a car that was somehow performing very well on low speed circuits, but we knew we had to work on new areas of development. For example, trying to develop the car to be strong in performance on the high-speed circuits, but also on reliability."</p>
